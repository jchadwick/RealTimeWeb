<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>
  Sites like Facebook have changed everything.
  From breaking news to status updates, things are happening in the world and people want to know about them RIGHT NOW!  
  "Traditional" AJAX approaches might get the job done, but they usually don't scale very well -- add more than a couple dozen users at the same time and watch your site crawl to a halt.
</p>

<p>It's time for something new - it's time for the Real-Time Web!</p>
