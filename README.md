Sites like Facebook have changed everything.
From breaking news to status updates, things are happening in the world and people want to know about them RIGHT NOW!

It's time for something new - it's time for the Real-Time Web!


## Demos

The following examples demostrate the various techniques for creating real-time websites, and how to implement those techniques in ASP.NET web applications
